# Java Programming

This Repository Contains sample programs, practice exercises and assessments of the course CSE1007 - Java Programming.

## Introduction


Created By - James Gosling, Sun MicroSystems (Originally Oak)

Originally used predominantly for Internet Programming - became a general purpose OOP Programming Language.

Both Compiler and Interpreter Based.

Code Once. Run Anywhere. 

Java Program is compiled into java byte code. This is used by the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) to be converted to native machine code in the host OS.

JRE - Java Runtime Environment - Physically Exists, Set of libraries and other files that JVM uses

JDK - Java Development Kit (JRE + Development Tools)

JDK and JRE are platform dependant but Java is platform independent.


### Compilation

**.java to .class (bytecode) -> java interpreter (part of JVM) -> machine code**

**java program -> java compiler -> JVM**


### Miscellaneous

1. Whenever your class name is public, then your class name and file name have to be same.
2. Character literals cannot have double quotes only single quotes. String literals have double quotes.
3. Using + for string concatenation with other data types is possible


### Errors

1. Syntax Errors / Compilation Errors
2. Runtime Errors - Errors and Exceptions
3. Logic Error - Programmer Error

### Objects

Everything is an object in java. Every Object has - State, Behavior (Functionality) and Identity (id is assigned and used internally by JVM)
